## Tech stack

The app went through multiple iterations to achieve what it is today, in coming days Ill move to material Design 3 and use jetpack compose.

The libraries used:

- [AppCompat](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/appcompat)
- [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/fragment)
- [Material Components](https://material.io/develop/android)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for login to account from email, google
- [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) for all the charts
- [Bottom Navigation](https://material.io/components/bottom-navigation/android) for bottom navigation
- [AndroidX Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) for handling navigation events

In order, this is what happens in the app:

1. Log into the account from email, google
2. If no account then sign up
3. Home shows bar chart for no. of week days in selected month and year
4. Pie shows static given 40,30,20,10 value

# Unit testing
Unit testing is not performed, as of now I lack experience in that. Will be done in upcoming days.
